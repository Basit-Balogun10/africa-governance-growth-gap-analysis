## 🏁 Phase 1: Setup & Ingestion (0% - 10%)

### ✅ Environment Setup
**Date:** November 29, 2025  
**What We Did:**
- Created Python virtual environment (`.venv`)
- Installed core packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `openpyxl`, `jupyter`
- Created project structure:
  ```
  data/raw/          # Raw datasets
  data/processed/    # Cleaned data
  notebooks/         # Analysis notebooks
  scripts/           # Reusable code
  ```

**Status:** ✅ Complete

### ✅ Data Loading & Initial Audit
**Date:** November 29, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**What We Did:**
- Loaded `data/raw/10Alytics Hackathon- Fiscal Data.csv` successfully
- Confirmed dataset structure: **23,784 rows × 9 columns**
- Confirmed **14 countries**, **27 indicators** across multiple years

**Key Findings:**

1. **✅ Data Quality Issues Identified:**
   - **Duplicate Indicators:** Found 2 indicators with trailing spaces:
     - `'GDP per Capita'` vs `'GDP per Capita '`
     - `'Inflation Rate'` vs `'Inflation Rate '`
   - **Amount Column is TEXT:** Needs conversion to numeric
     - Contains commas (e.g., `'3,883'`)
     - Contains non-breaking spaces (e.g., `'\xa0103.60'`)
     - 443 non-numeric values found
   - **Missing Values:**
     - Currency: 10,503 missing (44%)
     - Amount: 59 missing (0.25%)
     - Unit: 22 missing
     - Time: 4 missing
     - **Overall: 4.95% missing data** ✅ Good!

2. **🎯 SDG DATA COMPLETENESS (The Game Changer!):**

   **Top Tier (100% Complete - Our Winners!):**
   - **SDG 1 (No Poverty):** 100% - 2,090 data points
   - **SDG 3 (Good Health):** 100% - 366 data points
   - **SDG 4 (Quality Education):** 100% - 19 data points ⚠️ Small sample
   - **SDG 9 (Industry & Infrastructure):** 100% - 1,784 data points

   **Strong Tier (99%+ Complete):**
   - **SDG 8 (Economic Growth):** 99.79% - 7,027 data points (LARGEST!)
   - **SDG 16 (Governance):** 99.77% - 9,021 data points (2nd LARGEST!)
   - **SDG 10 (Inequality):** 99.58% - 2,378 data points

   **Good Tier:**
   - **SDG 2 (Zero Hunger):** 98.82% - 1,099 data points

**Key Decisions Made:**

✅ **Our Winning SDG Focus (3-5 SDGs with strongest stories):**

1. **SDG 8 (Economic Growth) - PRIMARY** 
   - 7,027 data points (most data!)
   - Covers: GDP, Unemployment, Tax Revenue, Exports, Imports, Labour Force
   - **Narrative Angle:** "Tax inefficiency → Low revenue → Economic stagnation"

2. **SDG 16 (Governance) - SECONDARY** 
   - 9,021 data points (2nd most data!)
   - Covers: Inflation, Interest Rate, VAT, CPI, Defence Spending
   - **Narrative Angle:** "Poor governance → Inflation volatility → Public trust erosion"

3. **SDG 9 (Infrastructure) - TERTIARY**
   - 1,784 data points (100% complete)
   - Covers: Capital Expenditure, Government Debt
   - **Narrative Angle:** "Rising debt but stagnant infrastructure → Debt trap"

4. **SDG 3 (Health) - VALIDATION**
   - 366 data points (100% complete)
   - Covers: Health Expenditure, Population
   - **Narrative Angle:** "The Efficiency Gap - spending ↑ but outcomes ?"

5. **SDG 1 (Poverty) - CONTEXT**
   - 2,090 data points (100% complete)
   - Covers: GDP per Capita, Real/Nominal GDP
   - **Supporting metric for overall development**

**🎯 The Winning Narrative Arc:**
**"The Governance-Growth Gap: Why African Nations Can't Translate Spending Into Progress"**
- Focus: SDG 8 (Growth) driven by SDG 16 (Governance) with SDG 9 (Infrastructure) as proof
- External data needed: Corruption Index, Infrastructure Quality Index, Poverty rates

## 🧹 Phase 2: Cleaning & Enrichment (10% - 30%)
**Date:** November 29, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete (Data Cleaning portion)

**What We Did:**

1. **✅ Fixed Duplicate Indicators:**
   - Stripped trailing spaces from indicator names
   - Reduced from 27 to 25 unique indicators
   - Fixed: `'Food Inflation '`, `'GDP per Capita '`, `'Inflation Rate '`

2. **✅ Converted Amount Column to Numeric:**
   - Removed commas (e.g., `'3,883'` → `3883`)
   - Removed non-breaking spaces (e.g., `'\xa0103.60'` → `103.60`)
   - Successfully converted 443 problematic text values
   - New column: `Amount_Clean` (float64)

3. **✅ Time Processing:**
   - Converted `Time` to datetime
   - Extracted `Year` column
   - **Year range:** 1960 - 2025 (66 years!)
   - Valid dates: 23,780 (only 4 invalid)

4. **✅ Frequency Aggregation (Monthly → Yearly):**
   - Identified monthly indicators: Inflation Rate, CPI, Food Inflation
   - Aggregated monthly data to yearly **averages**
   - **Reduction:** 23,784 rows → 4,871 rows (79.5% reduction)
   - Rationale: Yearly data is better for long-term SDG analysis

5. **✅ CRITICAL: Pivoted Long → Wide Format:**
   - **Before:** One row per Country-Indicator-Year observation
   - **After:** One row per Country-Year, columns = indicators
   - **Final shape:** 623 rows × 28 columns
   - Each row now represents a complete Country-Year snapshot

6. **✅ Strategic Missing Value Imputation:**
   - **Method:** Forward-fill → Backward-fill **within each country**
   - **Rationale:** Preserves country-specific economic trends
   - **Fallback:** Cross-country median for remaining NaNs
   - **Result:** 0 missing values in final dataset!

7. **✅ Saved Cleaned Data:**
   - Output: `data/processed/fiscal_data_clean.csv`
   - **623 Country-Year observations** ready for analysis
   - **14 countries** × ~45 years average coverage

**Key Insights:**
- Data spans **66 years** (1960-2025) - much longer than expected!
- Most complete data is from 2000-2023 (modern era)
- All SDG-relevant indicators preserved and cleaned

**Next:** External data enrichment (Corruption Index, Poverty rates, etc.)
